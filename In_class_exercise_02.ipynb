            " review:Pawan Kalyan has given an extraordinary performance. His comedy timing is perfect. He has delivered several punch dialog's with his inimitable mannerism. He is good in both action and dance sequences. Shruti Hassan looks gorgeous in the film. Her performance as an innocent village belle is excellent. Though she has a very small role to play, she has used the available space to show her acting prowess. While abundant action sequences are on expected lines, including slow-mo flips and kicks, it's really the wit that's a pleasant surprise (and breather!). Be it the action sequence or goons made to play Antakshari by Gabbar Singh in his police station, the fact that the film included spoof snippets on Pawan Kalyan's earlier films and songs, is a refreshing change. Ali, Brahmanandam and Ranjit Kumar tickle the funny bones of audiences. Combination scenes of Ali and Pawan Kalyan have been shot well. Other artistes like Suhasini, Nagineedu, Rao Ramesh, Abhimanyu Singh have done justice to their respective roles. What remains constant though is the fact that Pawan Kalyan (like Salman in the original) is the heart and soul of the enterprise. His comic timing, his attitude, his punch lines, mannerisms everything is tailor made to suit the role (or was it vice a versa) and Pawan delivers an immensely lovable rogue cop act. Pawan Kalyan fans will definitely have a field day with Gabbar Singh, yet those who do not think much of the star would enjoy this movie as much too despite the lackluster climax and slow second half. Watch it in a single screen with maddening fans for company and the fun quotient would just triple up. Pawan Kalyan fans have been waiting for so long to see their idol in this type of role. He took more time than needed. But finally he has delivered the goods with Gabbar Singh. Watch it!\n",

He looks very smart and has done acting according to the character which suits him well. This movie is an action cum comedy flick and has got good comedy accordingly. Even though its a remake of some movie it has got its own style which, all the people who watch Telugu movies would like. Brahmanandan has done excellent as usual. This movie will definitely entertain you which i can assure you. Those who like Pawan Kalyan's acting have to watch it. I would give 8/10.\n",

I watched it in a single screen, and the effect was mind-blowing. This movie is a treat for PK fans!!Overall, a decent film. If Salman Khan made Dabangg the third highest– grossing Bollywood film of all time, thanks to PK, Gabbar Singh has the potential to be the highest-grossing Tollywood film. Its boring at times, and makes you yawn. Nevertheless, its few amazing moments and what fans term as Pawanism make this film work.Acting: 7.5/10 Story-Screenplay-Direction: 6.5/10 Technical Aspects: 7/10 Is it worth your time and money??: After a couple of disasters, a decent Telugu film.

            " review:True to its description by Harish Shankar \" Akali to Vachhina Vallu Buktha Ayasam to Ee Cinema to Bayatiki Vellataru\" After Long Time folks of Andhra Pradesh have the opportunity to watch a Full Length Entertainer in the form of \"GABBAR SINGH\". Every aspect of the film is tantalizing.Gabbar Singh teases Salman Khan's 'DABBANG\" in every possible aspect in every possible way. Blockbuster of 2012 and will be the highest grossing of all the Telugu movies.Audience is going gaga and dancing in theaters, movie is filled with full doses of comedy right from minute one to the last second. Pawan Kalyan's dances were mesmerizing and some chiranjeevi shades were seen in some of the steps. Compliments to the choreographer and Devi Sri Prasad's magic touch in the form of music for the songs and background music. Every song was well written in terms of lyrics, singers sang them perfect , it was a visual treat.Songs are already Charbusting and Song Picturization complimented them and it was a visual treat to watch the songs . Not even a single scene could be written off every scene has the perfect mixture and blending of entertainment.Pawan Kalyan Dances are Simply Superb, though he is not a Good dancer per popular opinion but his dance moves are really moving and will move your legs.. Amitabh Bachan is not a good dancer but with the little moves he does people go gaga over his dances..same magic by PowerStar.Dialouges are a big boost to the movie and constantly add power and punches ..PowerStar's Comedy Timing is perfect, hats off to Harish Shankar for his dialogues and the Pawan Kalyans Powerful punches in them..\n",

            " review:StoryGabbar Singh (Pawan Kalyan) runs away from home at an early age and become a police officer and gets transferred to his village. He likes his mother (Suhasini) and dislikes his foster father (Nagineedu). Siddhappa Naidu (Abhimanyu Singh) is the big rowdy of the village who has aspirations to become a politician. Gabbar Singh cuts Siddhappa to his size and Siddhappa wants to take revenge. The rest of the story is about how Gabbar Singh executes everything in his style.Artists PerformancePawan Kalyan: It took almost 12 years and a director called Harish Shankar to bring out the character in Pawan Kalyan onto the screen the way people want to see it. Pawan Kalyan scorches the screen with his performance. Pawan Kalyan's attitude, body language and josh (some may call it over-acting) is perfectly extracted by the director. Pawan Kalyan has shown it again how an actor can own and carry it on when the right character is offered. Others: Shruti Hassan is adequate as lady love of Gabbar Singh. Abhimanyu Singh is fine. Ali is hilarious (or the way Pawan tells him 'samba raasuko'). Brahmanandam is okay in the first half and hilarious in Pawan Kalyan cutout scene in the second half. Suhasini and Nagineedu are good as parents. Tanikella Bharani has been properly utilized in this movie as the mentor of villain. Kota Srinivasa Rao has a short yet important role as heroine's father. Rao Ramesh played the role of a politician. Ajay is apt for the character of step brother. Gayatri Rao (Happy Days fame) has done the character of heroine's friend. The rowdy batch (headed by Fish Venkat) is hilarious in Antakshari scene in Police Station.Technical departmentsStory - screenplay - direction: The story of the film is an old-fashioned, but a workable one. What makes the difference to such an old-type story is the 'thikka' characterization by Harish Shankar. There are certain antics of Pawan Kalyan which appear like 'overr-acting' if not used well by the director. Harish Shankar has used them excellently to bring out hilariously entertaining episodes. His direction is good, but should have worked more on tight screenplay towards second half. The following scenes are true entertainers1. When Gabbar Singh introduces himself to the village men after the intro fight. 2. 'Samba raasuko' episodes 3. 'Are Gabbar Singh Ka Fauzia' episodes 4. Episode before and after Pelli Choopulu failure 5. Antakshari Episode. This is probably the highlight of the film. 6. Brahmanandam cutout buildup episode 7. References episodes (Kushi, Muta Mesthri and Jalsa) 8. Kota Thagubothu song sceneOther departments: Dialogues are the second most important technical aspect of the movie after characterization. Harish Shankar has come up with entertaining dialogues that suit Pawan Kalyan to a T. Background music is good and songs scored by Devi Sri Prasad are excellent. Cinematography is neat, but properly care should have been taken white shooting the slow-motion shots of hero introduction scene. Editing is fine and production values are okay. Analysis: First half of the film is highly entertaining. Second half has some story. Looks like this film is made with the sole purpose of entertainment with a workable script. Pawan Kalyan's inbuilt mannerism and attitude and merged perfectly by the character written for him. The film has 80% Pawan Kalyan and 20% rest of the cast. Plus points of the film are Pawan Kalyan's never-before entertainment, Harish Shankar's dialogues and characterization. The negative points are hurried climax and inadequate screenplay in the second half. The hero is more powerful than villain, hence the hero vs villain thread is weak. On a whole, Gabbar Singh is a good mass entertainer and will satisfy fans and general crowds alike who have been expecting a good entertainer from Pawan Kalyan over a decade.\n",

            " review:The film rarely bores you. Tightly packed screenplay. Pavan Kalyan carries the film on his shoulders with ease. His mannerisms are the same, his acting style is the same, but somehow it does not appear clichéd. He gives a nonchalant yet energetic performance. Devi Sri Prasad's songs are all good. From melodies to mass numbers, he did a very good job. The fanfare theme music that comes in the background every time Gabbar Singh appears on screen, is awesome; makes you hum and raises your spirits. Sruthi Hassan is a wasted talent. It could have been anyone else in the heroine's character - it does not make any difference. I enjoyed the film mainly because the whole theater was reverberating with the enthusiastic shouts of fans even during the second week after release. Pawan Kalyan gets the much needed hit after a long time. Like for any other mass hero's film, for Gabbar Singh too, just a positive talk is enough to create records.\n",

            " review:Gabbar singh (pawan kalyan ) comes to Kondaveedu village, as Police Inspector and confronts with local goon Siddhappa Naidu, who is an aspiring politician. The film is about the cat and mouse game between Gabbar and Siddhappa. Gabbar also has a love interest Bhagyalakshmi (Shruti Hassan) and there is a sentimental touch to this story in the form of Gabbar's family. Pawan Kalyan is like a live wire in this movie. He has been keeping his energy levels down by playing roles that doesn't require it. he is the heart, soul and mind of Gabbar Singh. After the duds, Komaram Puli and Panja, Pawan Kalyan is back with a vengeance, with Gabbar Singh, the free-style remake of Bollywood hit Dabangg. The Tollywood filmmakers have always found it hard to impress the audiences with remakes, but Gabbar Singh is an exception. Shruti Haasan looks sensuous and seductive. Though the dubbing for her was a little unusual, she managed to cover it up with her expressions and natural beauty. Not much scope for her in terms of performance. Harish Shankar has scripted the entire movie with hero-centric subject. The best part of movie is narration without any boring moments.being a hardcore PK fan,my rating is 10/10.\n",

            " review:Release date: 11 May 2012 Director : Harish Shankar Producer : Bandla Ganesh Music Director : Devi Sri Prasad Starring: Pawan Kalyan, Shruti Haasan, Malaika Arora, Abhimanyu Singh Power Star Pawan Kalyan's most eagerly anticipated flick 'Gabbar Singh' will be hitting the screens tomorrow and there are incredible expectations surrounding the film.The movie has been directed by Harish Shankar and Shruti Haasan is the heroine. . We have been treated to an exclusive special show so let us see how the movie is. Story : Venkatarathnam Naidu (Pawan Kalyan) is the son of Suhasini and the stepson of Naidu (Nagineedu). He loves Gabbar Singh's character from Sholay and so he decides to call himself 'Gabbar Singh'. He grows up into a daring and dashing but highly eccentric police officer. He is posted to his hometown of Kondaveedu and he decides to rid the population of law and order problems. This brings him into direct confrontation with Siddhappa Naidu (Abhimanyu Singh), the local goonda and a political aspirant. As Gabbar Singh goes about confronting Siddhappa Naidu, he comes across Bhagyalakshmi ( Shruti Haasan ) and falls in love with her. Things get murky as the story proceeds and strong human emotions like jealousy, hatred and greed come to the fore. Will Gabbar Singh be able to stop Siddhappa Naidu's atrocities? What price will he have to pay to achieve his goals? That forms the rest of the story. The movie is an adaptation of Salman Khan's 'Dabangg' and is not a straight remake. There are major changes in the story and in the treatment of characters. Plus Points : Pawan Kalyan is simply outstanding in the role of Gabbar Singh and he delivers beautifully on all counts. Pawan Fans will go into raptures of delight with his comedy, punch dialogues and mannerisms. He is excellent as always in the action sequences and he has performed some mass dances this time around. Shruti Haasan looks beautiful and innocent as the simple village girl. She does not have too much screen presence but she has done justice to whatever was given to her. Ali entertains as constable Samba and his scenes with Pawan are good. Brahmanandam rocks as Recovery Agent Ranjith Kumar. Suhasini and Nagineedu are decent in their respective roles. Abhimanyu Singh is just about OK as Siddhappa Naidu. Rao Ramesh is good in a brief role. Happy Days fame Gayatri gets a radically different character in the film and she will score points with the front benchers. The first half moves along at an incredible pace and it is highly entertaining with some solid dialogues. Some scenes like the one where Pawan makes an entry in a rickshaw with Megastar Chiranjeevi's 'Ee petaku nene mestri' playing in the background will score major brownie points with fans. Comedy quotient is high throughout most of the film. The antyakshari block in the police station is hilarious. The romantic track between Pawan and Shruti is very entertaining and it has been conceived very well by Harish Shankar. All the songs have been shot very well and 'Dil Se', 'Pilla' and 'Gabbar Singh' songs will stand out for beautiful visuals. Malaika Arora sizzles in 'Kevvu Keka' and this song will entice B and C center crowds. Minus Points : Ajay has a very small role and does not have much to do. Same goes for Kota Srinivasa Rao. Except for the 'Mandu Babulam' song, he does not have any significant role in the film. There have been some major changes in the script, particularly in the second half and perhaps, the original storyline from Dabangg should have been used. Tanikella Bharani's role does not do justice to his talent. The pace of narration dips slightly in the second half and care should have been taken to match the first half's tempo. The required emotional depth is missing in the run up towards the climax. The climax sequence could have been handled better. The voice used to dub for Shruti Haasan is a little odd. Technical Aspects : Cinematography is outstanding and the film has great visuals. In particular, the songs shot in Europe are beautiful and DI work is impressive, Editing is OK. Fights have been conceived well. Devi Sri's music is a major asset to the film and background score is impressive. Special mention must be made of Harish Shankar's dialogues. They are a major asset for the film and when delivered in Pawan's trademark fashion, the effect is outstanding. Harish succeeds brilliantly in the first half as a director but fails to repeat that brilliance in the second half. Verdict : Pawan Kalyan's fans will have a very enjoyable time while watching Gabbar Singh. The movie has good comedy, superb dialogues and some very entertaining episodes from Pawan. A faster second half and a better climax block would have really elevated the film. Still, the sheer brilliance of the first half and a sterling performance from Pawan make Gabbar Singh a solidly entertaining watch. Thumbs up for Gabbar Singh.\n",

            " review:The blockbuster of 2012 has to be remake of another blockbuster \"Dabanng\" just with Telugu Nativity.Now, it is considered to be remake of the Salman Khan starrer \"Dabanng\" and now we have similar recipe for the Telugu food loving people. Yet, except the plot line, I am not sure if there are any similarities. Now, I have not seen \"Dabanng\" and I did not want to see this film either coz this does not work for my sensibilities. I was said that this the best film of Pawan Kalyan after \"Khushi\", that came nearly 10 years ago. I was also told that there are few scenes that are brazenly original and highly comical like Antakshari scene etc. So I watched it one day in Sandhya Theatre, nearby my home. I was disappointed and started arguing with all those so called Pawan Kalyan fans. Now, what is original, the movie is something that we know, the title itself is a name of villain in \"Sholay\" and that Antakshari scene was done very well in a good original film \"Aithe\". So now, I was wondering what is original, yet this turns out to be super duper hit and indeed a blockbuster. Last year too we had a similar case, where \"Dookudu\" was a Telugu inspiration of the German Film \"Goodbye Lenin\". So this is where we stand, we embrace this and more bad things we are offered, more is what we love to eat. Gabbar Singh belongs to that very league again, just that here Pawan Kalyan who tried experiments but failed like \"Johnny\" gets back a slice to have his meal and now I suppose, he is satisfied with this dish. Having said that, there are few plus points and that is Music, Devisri Prasad has given some tunes and lyrics that are worth listening for many number of times, till we again delete them from collection. At least \"Mandubaabulam\" is one song and \"Pilla\" is another that will stick with for long time to come.I can't say much of this mediocre film in which we get to see same thing over and over and over again, and more worse is we never to have better films, we loved the bad films before, now we are addicted to them. Except few dialogues, I did not like anything in this, acting is stereotypical and the setup is age-old. If not for Pawan Kalyan, I dare say this film would have been a dud, but he brought something called \"Pawan style\" and that's what sold the film is what I believe. A standard 2/5 for an average film. Don't except anything ever please and you will be happy at the end.\n",

He is good in both action and dance sequences. Shruti Hassan looks gorgeous in the film. Her performance as an innocent village belle is excellent. Though she has a very small role to play, she has used the available space to show her acting prowess. While abundant action sequences are on expected lines, including slow-mo flips and kicks, it's really the wit that's a pleasant surprise (and breather!). Be it the action sequence or goons made to play Antakshari by Gabbar Singh in his police station, the fact that the film included spoof snippets on Pawan Kalyan's earlier films and songs, is a refreshing change. Ali, Brahmanandam and Ranjit Kumar tickle the funny bones of audiences. Combination scenes of Ali and Pawan Kalyan have been shot well. Other artistes like Suhasini, Nagineedu, Rao Ramesh, Abhimanyu Singh have done justice to their respective roles. What remains constant though is the fact that Pawan Kalyan (like Salman in the original) is the heart and soul of the enterprise. His comic timing, his attitude, his punch lines, mannerisms everything is tailor made to suit the role (or was it vice a versa) and Pawan delivers an immensely lovable rogue cop act. Pawan Kalyan fans will definitely have a field day with Gabbar Singh, yet those who do not think much of the star would enjoy this movie as much too despite the lackluster climax and slow second half. Watch it in a single screen with maddening fans for company and the fun quotient would just triple up. Pawan Kalyan fans have been waiting for so long to see their idol in this type of role. He took more time than needed. But finally he has delivered the goods with Gabbar Singh. Watch it!\n",

I watched it in a single screen, and the effect was mind-blowing. This movie is a treat for PK fans!!Overall, a decent film. If Salman Khan made Dabangg the third highest– grossing Bollywood film of all time, thanks to PK, Gabbar Singh has the potential to be the highest-grossing Tollywood film. Its boring at times, and makes you yawn. Nevertheless, its few amazing moments and what fans term as Pawanism make this film work.Acting: 7.5/10 Story-Screenplay-Direction: 6.5/10 Technical Aspects: 7/10 Is it worth your time and money??: After a couple of disasters, a decent Telugu film.

Every aspect of the film is tantalizing.Gabbar Singh teases Salman Khan's 'DABBANG\" in every possible aspect in every possible way. Blockbuster of 2012 and will be the highest grossing of all the Telugu movies.Audience is going gaga and dancing in theaters, movie is filled with full doses of comedy right from minute one to the last second. Pawan Kalyan's dances were mesmerizing and some chiranjeevi shades were seen in some of the steps. Compliments to the choreographer and Devi Sri Prasad's magic touch in the form of music for the songs and background music. Every song was well written in terms of lyrics, singers sang them perfect , it was a visual treat.Songs are already Charbusting and Song Picturization complimented them and it was a visual treat to watch the songs . Not even a single scene could be written off every scene has the perfect mixture and blending of entertainment.Pawan Kalyan Dances are Simply Superb, though he is not a Good dancer per popular opinion but his dance moves are really moving and will move your legs.. Amitabh Bachan is not a good dancer but with the little moves he does people go gaga over his dances..same magic by PowerStar.Dialouges are a big boost to the movie and constantly add power and punches ..PowerStar's Comedy Timing is perfect, hats off to Harish Shankar for his dialogues and the Pawan Kalyans Powerful punches in them..\n",

            " review:StoryGabbar Singh (Pawan Kalyan) runs away from home at an early age and become a police officer and gets transferred to his village. He likes his mother (Suhasini) and dislikes his foster father (Nagineedu). Siddhappa Naidu (Abhimanyu Singh) is the big rowdy of the village who has aspirations to become a politician. Gabbar Singh cuts Siddhappa to his size and Siddhappa wants to take revenge. The rest of the story is about how Gabbar Singh executes everything in his style.Artists PerformancePawan Kalyan: It took almost 12 years and a director called Harish Shankar to bring out the character in Pawan Kalyan onto the screen the way people want to see it. Pawan Kalyan scorches the screen with his performance. Pawan Kalyan's attitude, body language and josh (some may call it over-acting) is perfectly extracted by the director. Pawan Kalyan has shown it again how an actor can own and carry it on when the right character is offered. Others: Shruti Hassan is adequate as lady love of Gabbar Singh. Abhimanyu Singh is fine. Ali is hilarious (or the way Pawan tells him 'samba raasuko'). Brahmanandam is okay in the first half and hilarious in Pawan Kalyan cutout scene in the second half. Suhasini and Nagineedu are good as parents. Tanikella Bharani has been properly utilized in this movie as the mentor of villain. Kota Srinivasa Rao has a short yet important role as heroine's father. Rao Ramesh played the role of a politician. Ajay is apt for the character of step brother. Gayatri Rao (Happy Days fame) has done the character of heroine's friend. The rowdy batch (headed by Fish Venkat) is hilarious in Antakshari scene in Police Station.Technical departmentsStory - screenplay - direction: The story of the film is an old-fashioned, but a workable one. What makes the difference to such an old-type story is the 'thikka' characterization by Harish Shankar. There are certain antics of Pawan Kalyan which appear like 'overr-acting' if not used well by the director. Harish Shankar has used them excellently to bring out hilariously entertaining episodes. His direction is good, but should have worked more on tight screenplay towards second half. The following scenes are true entertainers1. When Gabbar Singh introduces himself to the village men after the intro fight. 2. 'Samba raasuko' episodes 3. 'Are Gabbar Singh Ka Fauzia' episodes 4. Episode before and after Pelli Choopulu failure 5. Antakshari Episode. This is probably the highlight of the film. 6. Brahmanandam cutout buildup episode 7. References episodes (Kushi, Muta Mesthri and Jalsa) 8. Kota Thagubothu song sceneOther departments: Dialogues are the second most important technical aspect of the movie after characterization. Harish Shankar has come up with entertaining dialogues that suit Pawan Kalyan to a T. Background music is good and songs scored by Devi Sri Prasad are excellent. Cinematography is neat, but properly care should have been taken white shooting the slow-motion shots of hero introduction scene. Editing is fine and production values are okay. Analysis: First half of the film is highly entertaining. Second half has some story. Looks like this film is made with the sole purpose of entertainment with a workable script. Pawan Kalyan's inbuilt mannerism and attitude and merged perfectly by the character written for him. The film has 80% Pawan Kalyan and 20% rest of the cast. Plus points of the film are Pawan Kalyan's never-before entertainment, Harish Shankar's dialogues and characterization. The negative points are hurried climax and inadequate screenplay in the second half. The hero is more powerful than villain, hence the hero vs villain thread is weak. On a whole, Gabbar Singh is a good mass entertainer and will satisfy fans and general crowds alike who have been expecting a good entertainer from Pawan Kalyan over a decade.\n",

            " review:The film rarely bores you. Tightly packed screenplay. Pavan Kalyan carries the film on his shoulders with ease. His mannerisms are the same, his acting style is the same, but somehow it does not appear clichéd. He gives a nonchalant yet energetic performance. Devi Sri Prasad's songs are all good. From melodies to mass numbers, he did a very good job. The fanfare theme music that comes in the background every time Gabbar Singh appears on screen, is awesome; makes you hum and raises your spirits. Sruthi Hassan is a wasted talent. It could have been anyone else in the heroine's character - it does not make any difference. I enjoyed the film mainly because the whole theater was reverberating with the enthusiastic shouts of fans even during the second week after release. Pawan Kalyan gets the much needed hit after a long time. Like for any other mass hero's film, for Gabbar Singh too, just a positive talk is enough to create records.\n",

The film is about the cat and mouse game between Gabbar and Siddhappa. Gabbar also has a love interest Bhagyalakshmi (Shruti Hassan) and there is a sentimental touch to this story in the form of Gabbar's family. Pawan Kalyan is like a live wire in this movie. He has been keeping his energy levels down by playing roles that doesn't require it. he is the heart, soul and mind of Gabbar Singh. After the duds, Komaram Puli and Panja, Pawan Kalyan is back with a vengeance, with Gabbar Singh, the free-style remake of Bollywood hit Dabangg. The Tollywood filmmakers have always found it hard to impress the audiences with remakes, but Gabbar Singh is an exception. Shruti Haasan looks sensuous and seductive. Though the dubbing for her was a little unusual, she managed to cover it up with her expressions and natural beauty. Not much scope for her in terms of performance. Harish Shankar has scripted the entire movie with hero-centric subject. The best part of movie is narration without any boring moments.being a hardcore PK fan,my rating is 10/10.\n",
